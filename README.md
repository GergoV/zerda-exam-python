## 6. Question time! (~30 mins) [6p]

### Explain the algorithm seen in `third.py`. Use a flowchart, structogram or pseudo code. [2p]
#### Your answer:

### How can you create a graphical user interface and draw a rectangle on it in python? What are the tools needed for it? [2p]
#### Your answer:

Python has various libraries for graphics. Tkinter is one of them: it may need additional packages such as PIL (supposedly deprecated) and Pillow (open source alternative of PIL).

To create simple graphics, tkinter has to be imported.
You create a window by instantiating one, usually named 'root', with a Tk() class. You can draw on it after creating a tkinter canvas. Tkinter has its own rectangle function for drawing the shape.

### What does V stand for in MVC? [2p]
#### Your answer:

View. The component of the program that is responsible for displaying the software's output and the user interface.
